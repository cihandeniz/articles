title: Music Only Suggests, Rest Is Done by Listener
---

A song or an arrangement shouldn't be fully done. It is required to lack, so
that the missing parts are filled by the listeners in their own heads. That's
the only way to get your song into someone else's head.

If your music is full, it completely represents you and there is no room left
for others to get in. If your music is full, you only make everyone else a
spectator. It becomes your show and your show only.

When you arrange, leave some parts out, only suggest them. And let the listeners
be part of your arrangement. Let them listen to their own unique song.
